Redux middleware for sending error reports to Sentry through raven-js.

Will automatically send an error report upon encountering a Javascript error
on dispatching any action. redux-raven-middleware will pass in the error as
well as extra information such as the action that caused the error and the
entire Redux application state.

## RavenMiddleware(sentryDSN, sentryConfig, middlewareOptions)

Creates a Raven Middleware.

- `sentryDSN` -- string representing your Sentry instance.
- `sentryConfig` -- object that will be passed into Raven.config.
- `middlewareOptions` -- object to customize the middleware:
 - `actionTransformer` -- transform the action before sending to Sentry
 - `stateTransformer` -- transform the state before sending to Sentry
 - `logger` -- log function to use instead of `console.error`
 - `enableBreadcrumbsCapture` -- whether to send breadcrumbs as part of request

```js
import {applyMiddleware, createStore} from 'redux';
import RavenMiddleware from 'redux-raven-middleware';


const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
  RavenMiddleware('my-sentry-dsn')
)(createStore);
```
